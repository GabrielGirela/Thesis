abstract={Oceanic hotspots are generally accepted to be the manifestations of plumes of hot, upwelling mantle material1,2, but the nature of such flows remains enigmatic. Iceland, for example, is one of the most thoroughly investigated hotspots, yet previous seismological3--5 and geodynamic6--12 studies have been unable to constrain the width or temperature of the plume. Here we report the results of a regional broadband seismic experiment undertaken to determine the three-dimensional velocity structure of the upper mantle beneath Iceland using relative travel times of body waves from teleseismic earthquakes. Inversion solutions of the data show a cylindrical zone of low P- and S-wave velocities that extends from 100km to at least 400km depth beneath central Iceland. The radius of the low-velocity anomaly is about 150km, and its magnitude is approximately 2{\%} for P waves and 4{\%} for S waves, indicating that Iceland is underlain by a hot, narrow plume of upwelling mantle.},

abstract = {We present a high-resolution S-velocity model of the North Atlantic region, revealing structural features in unprecedented detail down to a depth of 1300km. The model is derived using full-waveform tomography. More specifically, we minimise the instantaneous phase misfit between synthetic and observed body- as well as surface-waveforms iteratively in a full three-dimensional, adjoint inversion. Highlights of the model in the upper mantle include a well-resolved Mid-Atlantic Ridge and two distinguishable strong low-velocity regions beneath Iceland and beneath the Kolbeinsey Ridge west of Jan Mayen. A sub-lithospheric low-velocity layer is imaged beneath much of the oceanic lithosphere, consistent with the long-wavelength bathymetric high of the North Atlantic. The low-velocity layer extends locally beneath the continental lithosphere of the southern Scandinavian Mountains, the Danish Basin, part of the British Isles and eastern Greenland. All these regions experienced post-rift uplift in Neogene times, for which the underlying mechanism is not well understood. The spatial correlation between the low-velocity layer and uplifted regions suggests dynamic support by low-density asthenosphere originating from the Iceland and Jan Mayen hotspots. Our model further suggests a lower-mantle source for the Iceland and Jan Mayen hotspots. Two distinguishable low-velocity conduits are imaged, connecting the upper-mantle anomalies beneath Iceland and Jan Mayen into the lower mantle. Both conduits are tilted to the South-East, reflecting the westward motion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The location of the imaged Iceland conduit is in agreement with the observation of a locally thinned transition zone south of Iceland from receiver function studies.}

abstract = {Seismic reflection and refraction data acquired on four transects spanning the Southeast Greenland rifted margin and Greenland–Iceland Ridge (GIR) provide new constraints on mantle thermal structure and melting processes during continental breakup in the North Atlantic. Maximum igneous crustal thickness varies along the margin from >30 km in the near-hotspot zone (<500 km from the hotspot track) to ∼18 km in the distal zone (500–1100 km). Magmatic productivity on summed conjugate margins of the North Atlantic decreases through time from 1800±300 to 600±50 km3/km/Ma in the near-hotspot zone and from 700±200 to 300±50 km3/km/Ma in the distal zone. Comparison of our data with the British/Faeroe margins shows that both symmetric and asymmetric conjugate volcanic rifted margins exist. Joint consideration of crustal thickness and mean crustal seismic velocity suggests that along-margin changes in magmatism are principally controlled by variations in active upwelling rather than mantle temperature. The thermal anomaly (ΔT) at breakup was modest (∼100–125°C), varied little along the margin, and transient. Data along the GIR indicate that the potential temperature anomaly (125±50°C) and upwelling ratio (∼4 times passive) of the Iceland hotspot have remained roughly constant since 56 Ma. Our results are consistent with a plume–impact model, in which (1) a plume of radius ∼300 km and ΔT of ∼125°C impacted the margin around 61 Ma and delivered warm material to distal portions of the margin; (2) at breakup (56 Ma), the lower half of the plume head continued to feed actively upwelling mantle into the proximal portion of the margin; and (3) by 45 Ma, both the remaining plume head and the distal warm layer were exhausted, with excess magmatism thereafter largely confined to a narrow (<200 km radius) zone immediately above the Iceland plume stem. Alternatively, the warm upper mantle layer that fed excess magmatism in the distal portion of the margin may have been a pre-existing thermal anomaly unrelated to the plume.}

The present-day hotspot is located under eastern Iceland offset about 240 km east of the Reykjanes and Kolbeinsey ridges. At 40 Ma, the Kangerlussuaq region of East Greenland would have been directly above the hotspot. The anomalous postdrift uplift of the East Greenland margin can also be explained by passage of the rifted margin over a hotspot. At 60 Ma, the Umanak Fjord region of the west coast of Greenland was above the hotspot, where picrites and hyaloclastites of nearby Disko Island are dated at ∼64 to 59 Ma. Our reconstruction shows Ellesmere Island above the hotspot between 130 and 100 Ma. Latest Albian to early Cenomanian volcanic rocks on Axel Heiberg Island and northern Ellesmere Island indicate a nearby hotspot at that time. At 130 Ma, our model locates the hotspot near the northern margin of Ellesmere Island, close to the intersection of the Alpha Ridge with the coast. The hotspot would have been located beneath the Arctic Alaska-Chukotka plate when it formed the Mendeleyev Ridge, and as the spreading center migrated over the hotspot, it transferred to the North American plate, where it formed the Alpha Ridge. Our model suggests that the initiation of the Iceland hotspot predates the opening of the North Atlantic by at least 70 m.y. and that the massive early Tertiary volcanism along the North Atlantic plate margins reflects the effect of rifting in the vicinity of existing thinned crust, rather than the arrival of a plume head.},

The Iceland and Yellowstone hotspots have generated successive CFB provinces, large intrusive complexes, anomalous uplift, basin formation, and rifting events, and linear volcanic chains dating back >120 and >70 Ma, respectively. Amagmatic intervals occurred: (1) when ascent of plumes to shallow levels was impeded by impenetrable lithosphere, resulting in sub-lithospheric ponding of plume mantle; and (2) in response to dispersion by subducting oceanic lithosphere in convergent margin settings. By comparison with the plume eruptive potential of typical oceanic hotspots, it is apparent that preservation of only a small portion of plume mantle ponded during an amagmatic interval is necessary to account for large volume of CFBs. Thermal erosion, lithospheric attenuation, translation of ponded hotspot mantle to the base of thinner penetrable lithosphere, and passage of plume mantle through slab windows in subducting oceanic lithosphere led to subsequent breakthrough and eruption of CFB. Since both mantle plume and plate tectonic processes have been operating since the Archean, it seems likely that the migration of continents over hotspots, with attendant magmatic and tectonic consequences, is a common occurrence in the geological record.}

abstract = {We present a new global model for Recent plate velocities, REVEL, describing the relative velocities of 19 plates and continental blocks. The model is derived from publicly available space geodetic (primarily GPS) data for the period 1993–2000. We include an independent and rigorous estimate for GPS velocity uncertainties to assess plate rigidity and propagate these uncertainties to the velocity estimates. The velocity fields for North America, Eurasia, and Antarctica clearly show the effects of glacial isostatic adjustment, and Australia appears to depart from rigid plate behavior in a manner consistent with the mapped intraplate stress field. Two thirds of tested plate pairs agree with the NUVEL-1A geologic (3 Myr average) velocities within uncertainties. Three plate pairs (Caribbean–North America, Caribbean–South America, and North America–Pacific) exhibit significant differences between the geodetic and geologic model that may reflect systematic errors in NUVEL-1A due to the use of seafloor magnetic rate data that do not reflect the full plate rate because of tectonic complexities. Most other differences probably reflect real velocity changes over the last few million years. Several plate pairs (Arabia–Eurasia, Arabia–Nubia, Eurasia–India) move more slowly than the 3 Myr NUVEL-1A average, perhaps reflecting long-term deceleration associated with continental collision. Several other plate pairs, including Nazca–Pacific, Nazca–South America and Nubia–South America, are experiencing slowing that began ∼25 Ma, the beginning of the current phase of Andean crustal shortening.},

Of the two parallel branches of the plate boundary in south Iceland, the eastern volcanic zone is currently taking up the majority of the spreading and little is left for the western volcanic zone. The plate boundary deformation field has been locally and temporarily affected in south Iceland by two Mw = 6.5 earthquakes in June 2000, inflation at Katla volcano during 2000 to 2004, and an eruption of Hekla volcano in February 2000.

Our interpretations have revealed several new potential abandoned rift centres, mapped as syncline and anticline structures. The synclines are suggested to be manifestations of former rift axes that were abandoned by rift jumps. These appear to be more common inside the GIFRC region than in the adjacent ocean basins, and can be confirmed by observations of cumulative crustal accretion data through time. A major post-40 Ma unconformity is proposed across the East Iceland Shelf, forming a distinct 16–20 myr-long hiatus that is covered by a thick, younger sedimentary section.Several seamounts were identified on multibeam datasets at around 1200 m water depth in the Vesturdjúp Basin, just south of the Greenland–Iceland Ridge. These seamounts appear to be younger in formation time than the surrounding ocean floor, possibly indicating a still active intraplate volcanic zone. Young tectonic features, such as faults, graben and transverse ridges, characterize the area and present a good example of the complexity of the GIFRC in comparison to the adjacent abyssal plain.},

abstract = {Hotspot–ridge interaction produces a wide range of phenomena including excess crustal thickness, geochemical anomalies, off-axis volcanic ridges and ridge relocations or jumps. Ridges are recorded to have jumped toward many hotspots including, Iceland, Discovery, Galápagos, Kerguelen and Tristan de Cuhna. The causes of ridge jumps likely involve a number of interacting processes related to hotspots. One such process is reheating of the lithosphere as magma penetrates it to feed near-axis volcanism. We study this effect by using the hybrid, finite-element code, FLAC, to simulate two-dimensional (2-D, cross-section) viscous mantle flow, elasto-plastic deformation of the lithosphere and heat transport in a ridge setting near an off-axis hotspot. Heating due to magma transport through the lithosphere is implemented within a hotspot region of fixed width. To determine the conditions necessary to initiate a ridge jump, we vary four parameters: hotspot magmatic heating rate, spreading rate, seafloor age at the location of the hotspot and ridge migration rate. Our results indicate that the hotspot magmatic heating rate required to initiate a ridge jump increases non-linearly with increasing spreading rate and seafloor age. Models predict that magmatic heating, itself, is most likely to cause jumps at slow spreading rates such as at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge on Iceland. In contrast, despite the higher magma flux at the Galápagos hotspot, magmatic heating alone is probably insufficient to induce a ridge jump at the present-day due to the intermediate ridge spreading rate of the Galápagos Spreading Center. The time required to achieve a ridge jump, for fixed or migrating ridges, is found to be on the order of 105–106 years. Simulations that incorporate ridge migration predict that after a ridge jump occurs the hotspot and ridge migrate together for time periods that increase with magma flux. Model results also suggest a mechanism for ridge reorganizations not related to hotspots such as ridge jumps in back-arc settings and ridge segment propagation along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.}

abstract = {The mid-Atlantic plate boundary in Iceland is expressed by a series of seismic and volcanic zones. The structure of the plate boundary is strongly influenced by the Iceland hot spot. The relative motion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge with respect to the hot spot leads to ridge jumps, propagating rifts and other complexities. Most large earthquakes in Iceland occur within two transform zones that connect the presently active Northern and Eastern Volcanic Zones to the ridges offshore. In the south the South Iceland Seismic Zone is marked by a 10–15 km wide, E-trending epicentral belt. The large earthquakes occur by faulting on N-S striking right-lateral faults. The left-lateral transform motion along the zone thus appears to be taken up by slip on numerous parallel faults by counterclockwise rotation of the blocks between them (bookshelf tectonics). It is argued that the South Iceland Seismic Zone is a transient feature, migrating sideways in response to propagation of the Eastern Volcanic Zone. In Northern Iceland the transform motion is taken up along the Tjörnes Fracture Zone. At least three parallel, NW-trending seismic belts have been identified within the zone. The seismicity of the volcanic zones is characterized by spatial clustering of epicenters. Most clusters coincide with central volcanoes. Rifting structures such as fissure swarms and normal faults are mostly aseismic except during episodes of rifting and magmatism such as the present events in Krafla. Earthquake recording has been used very successfully at Krrafla to monitor the level of inflation and deflation of the volcano, and to trace the path and speed of lateral magmatic intrusions into the associated fissure swarm. Seismic activity at the Bárdarbunga volcano in Central Iceland correlates in time with the Krafla events, and it seems as if inflation of Krafla is followed by deflation of Bárdarbunga. It is postulated that the pressure drop in the partially molten mantle beneath Krafla is transmitted to neighboring volcanoes, leading to magma withdrawal from their shallow reservoirs. Bursts of seismicity of the Katla volcano in South Iceland in 1967 and 1977 may similarly be the result of magma withdrawal in response to the 1964–1967 Surtsey and 1973 Heimaey eruptions. Annual periodicity seen in the Katla seismicity is explained as the result of the triggering effect of pore pressure in the crust beneath the glacier covering Katla. Several volcanoes exhibit persistent, low-magnitude seismicity. In the Hengill volcano in Southwest Iceland, many events involve a non-double-couple mechanism. The seismicity is interpreted as the result of extensional failure and heat extraction from a cooling magma chamber. Two classes of intraplate earthquakes have been identified in Iceland. One includes events in the lithospheric blockbetween the transform zones. These events are related to crustal extension above the hot spot. The other class includes events on the insular shelf off the east and southeast coasts which are possibly caused by a differential cooling rate in the crust across the shelf edge.}

The full plate spreading rate in this region during the Cenozoic has been ∼2 cm a−1, and thus these rocks are expected to be separated by ∼290 km. They are, however, ∼500 km apart. The conclusion is inescapable that an expanse of older crust ∼210 km wide underlies Iceland, submerged beneath younger lavas. This conclusion is independent of any considerations regarding spreading ridge migrations, jumps, the simultaneous existence of multiple active ridges, three-dimensionality, or subsidence of the lava pile. Such complexities bear on the distribution and age of the older crust, but not on its existence or its width. If it is entirely oceanic its maximum age is most likely 26–37 Ma. It is at least 150 km in north–south extent, but may taper and extend beneath south Iceland. Part of it might be continental—a southerly extension of the Jan Mayen microcontinent. This older crust contributes significantly to crustal thickness beneath Iceland and the ∼40 km local thickness measured seismically is thus probably an overestimate of present-day steady-state crustal production at Iceland.},

abstract = {Magnetotelluric measurements have revealed a crustal thickness of 8–10 km in the axial rift zone of NE Iceland and above the proposed hot spot in central east and north Iceland. The crust thickens with age and is 20–30 km thick in the older Tertiary areas to the east and west of the axial rift zone. It also thickens toward north with increasing distance from the hot spot. The crust is underlain by a diapiric updoming asthenosphere over large parts of the country. At the crust asthenosphere interface there is a partially molten basaltic layer a few kilometers thick. This layer partially decouples the crust from the anomalous mantle. Its low viscosity may explain the spatial and temporal instability of the rift axis and the high mobility of the crust during technically active periods. A major volcano-tectonic rifting episode started in the Krafla area in 1975 involving an 80-km-long segment of the plate boundary. Several meters of opening accompanied by subsidence was observed in the center of the axial fissure swarm and contraction and uplift occurred on the sides. The rifting occurred in several short events. Magma flowed horizontally from an upper crustal magma chamber and mixed with magma ascending directly from the semifluid layer at the base of the crust. Crustal accretion was mainly engineered by dike intrusions. Only a minor part of the magma transported reached the surface. During technically quiet epochs, plate-driving forces, caused by the upwelling asthenosphere, result in long-term stretching and accumulation of tensile stress in the thinnest part of the crust. The vertical and horizontal displacements during rifting episodes can be explained by elastic rebound, where fissure opening accompanied by magma flow causes the release of tension.},

abstract = {Basaltic lavas, forming thick offshore seaward-dipping reflector sequences (SDRS) and onshore igneous provinces around the North Atlantic margins, represent melting of anomalously hot mantle in the head of the ancestral Iceland plume. Some of these lavas are chemically and isotopically indistinguishable from recent Icelandic basalt, but others more closely resemble basalt erupted at normal segments of mid-ocean ridges (N-MORB). In this paper we show that Icelandic basalt and N-MORB define parallel tight arrays on a plot oflog(Nb/Y) against log(Zr/Y), with N-MORB relatively deficient in Nb. Deficiency or excess of Nb, relative to the lower bound of the Iceland array, may be expressed as ΔNb=1.74+log⁡(Nb/Y)−1.92log⁡(Zr/Y)such that Icelandic basalt has ΔNb > 0 and N-MORB has ΔNb < 0. ΔNb is a fundamental source characteristic and is insensitive to the effects of variable degrees of mantle melting, source depletion through melt extraction, crustal contamination of the magmas, or subsequent alteration. We use new and published Nb, Zr and Y data to identify the mantle sources for Palaeocene and Eocene basaltic lavas erupted around the Atlantic margins in order to deduce the thermal and compositional structure of the head of the ancestral Iceland plume. The results show that the head of the plume was zoned, with an axial zone of Icelandic mantle surrounded by a thick outer shell of anomalously hot but compositionally normal N-MORB-source mantle. The zoning is very similar in scale and character to that seen today along the Reykjanes Ridge and is difficult to reconcile with the initiation of rifting and SDRS formation through the impact of a large plume head originating solely from the lower mantle. The thick outer shell of hot, depleted upper mantle, which formed more than half the volume of the plume head, suggests that at least part of the plume originated in the thermal boundary layer at the base of the upper mantle.}

ABSTRACT={<p>The dynamics of magma is often studied through 2D numerical simulations because 3D simulations are usually complex and computationally expensive. However, magmatic systems and physical processes are 3D and approximating them in 2D requires an evaluation of the information which is lost under different conditions. This work presents a physical and numerical model for 3D magma convection dynamics. The model is applied to study the dynamics of magma convection and mixing between andesitic and dacitic magmas. The 3D simulation results are compared with corresponding 2D simulations. We also provide details on the numerical scheme and its parallel implementation in C++ for high-performance computing. The performance of the numerical code is evaluated through strong scaling exercises involving up to <inline-formula id="inf1"><mml:math id="m1" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>12,000 cores.</p>}

ABSTRACT = {The complexity of the Krafla volcano and its geothermal system(s) has puzzled geoscientists for decades. New and old geoscientific studies are reviewed in order to shed some light on this complexity. The geological structure and history of the volcano is more complex than hitherto believed. The visible 110 ka caldera hosts, now buried, an 80 ka inner caldera. Both calderas are bisected by an ESE-WNW transverse low-density structure. Resistivity surveys show that geothermal activity has mainly been within the inner caldera but cut through by the ESE-WNW structure. The complexity of the geothermal system in the main drill field can be understood by considering the tectonic history. Isotope composition of the thermal fluids strongly suggests at least three different geothermal systems. Silicic magma encountered in wells K-39 and IDDP-1 indicates a hitherto overlooked heat transport mechanism in evolved volcanos. Basaltic intrusions into subsided hydrothermally altered basalt melt the hydrated parts, producing a buoyant silicic melt which migrates upwards forming sills at shallow crustal levels which are heat sources for the geothermal system above. This can explain the bimodal behavior of evolved volcanos like Krafla and Askja, with occasional silicic, often phreatic, eruptions but purely basaltic in-between. When substantial amounts of silicic intrusions/magma have accumulated, major basalt intrusion(s) may “ignite” them causing a silicic eruption.},

The numerical approach is continuous in space and discontinuous in time. The proposed method starts by the use of a stabilized space–time variational formulation, which allows the use of the same order interpolation functions for all solution variables. The numerical technique is tested through comparison with standard compressible and incompressible flow benchmarks. Compressible flow cases include 1D and 2D shock problems. Incompressible flow cases include lid-driven cavity flow and flow over a backward-facing step computed over a range of Re numbers. The results demonstrate high stability and accuracy of the numerical technique over a wide range of flow regimes, suggesting straightforward extension to many flow cases not yet investigated.}

Fluid flow problem is solved with time-discontinuous deforming domain stabilized space-time finite element method. Flow is computed with pressure primitive variables which permit to use the same numerical technique for both compressible and incompressible regimes. Elastic deformation of the structure is modelled in the Lagrangian frame of reference with Saint-Venant Kirchhoff and Neo-Hookean material models - both are non-linear and valid for large deformations. Structure equations are discretized with Galerkin finite element method for space and with generalized-alpha method for the time. Mesh motion is modelled with the elastic deformation method. An implicit algorithm is presented to couple the different solvers. The details are provided on the implementation of the solvers in parallel software. The numerical code is verified and validated on several compressible and incompressible flow benchmarks widely used in the literature. The results demonstrate that the developed solver successfully detects the accurate interaction between fluid and structure.}

Cashman et al. review the evidence that shallow magma chambers are actually assembled quickly from much larger, crystal-rich transcrustal magmatic systems. This paradigm helps explain many geophysical and geochemical features of volcanic systems. It also presents challenges for understanding the evolution of magma and provides insight into how and why volcanoes erupt. Science, this issue p. eaag3055 Shallow magma chambers are ephemeral expressions of larger transcrustal magmatic systems. Volcanoes are an expression of their underlying magmatic systems. Over the past three decades, the classical focus on upper crustal magma chambers has expanded to consider magmatic processes throughout the crust. A transcrustal perspective must balance slow (plate tectonic) rates of melt generation and segregation in the lower crust with new evidence for rapid melt accumulation in the upper crust before many volcanic eruptions. Reconciling these observations is engendering active debate about the physical state, spatial distribution, and longevity of melt in the crust. Here we review evidence for transcrustal magmatic systems and highlight physical processes that might affect the growth and stability of melt-rich layers, focusing particularly on conditions that cause them to destabilize, ascend, and accumulate in voluminous but ephemeral shallow magma chambers.}}

In this work the development by Hauke and Hughes [A comparative study of different sets of variables for solving compressible and incompressible flows. Comput Methods Appl Mech Eng 1998;153:1–44] to pressure primitive variables is extended to single-fluid multicomponent compressible and incompressible flows of gas–liquid mixtures at local mechanical and chemical equilibrium. The stabilized algorithm is implemented in a parallel C++ library, which is tested on several benchmarks. The solution of the system of equations for the conservation of mass of each component, and of momentum and energy of the global mixture, requires the introduction of mass fractions as primitive variables to describe mixture composition. The weak formulation, the stabilization parameters, and the time-marching algorithm are rewritten in terms of the expanded set of variables, keeping similarity with the formulation in pressure variables.}

abstract = {The volatile saturation surface in H2O–CO2–silicate melt systems is modeled by applying thermodynamic equilibrium between gaseous and liquid volatile components. The whole database of existing saturation data in the C–O–H–silicate liquid systems has allowed us to re-calibrate a previously developed fully multicomponent H2O–CO2 saturation model [Papale, P., 1999. Modeling of the solubility of a two-component H2O+CO2 fluid in silicate liquid. Am. Mineral., 84, 477–492]. The new database nearly doubles the previous one, greatly improving the performances of the whole model, which now adopts a significantly lower number of model parameters with respect to the previous calibration. The multicomponent H2O+CO2 saturation model is fully non-ideal, the only assumption being that the excess Gibbs free energy of the silicate mixture can be represented by an expansion of first-order symmetric interaction terms. No a-priori assumption is made on the P–T dependence of the volatile–oxide interaction terms, meaning that no assumption is made on the partial molar volume and enthalpy of the dissolved volatiles. The whole treatment is evaluated by restrictive statistical algorithms, which confirm the model validity on an extended database. The model allows to investigate extensively the dependence of the complex volatile saturation surface on composition. In order to explore the non-linear behaviors implicit in the physics of the dissolution process, the model is employed in a series of calculations aimed at illustrating some of the compositional features of the volatile saturation surface in both one-component and two-component volatile conditions. The results show compositional-dependent minima and maxima, some of which are known from the experiments. Non-ideal behavior is enhanced in two-component fluid phase conditions and pressures above a few hundreds MPa, where calculated isobaric H2O–CO2 saturation curves reveal the possible existence of a maximum in CO2 saturation at non-zero H2O contents. Due to the compositional dependence of the volatile saturation surface, it is outlined the important role played by redox conditions, especially in iron-rich melt systems like basalts.}

    abstract = {Silicic magma systems are of great scientific interest and societal importance owing to their role in the evolution of the crust and the hazards posed by volcanic eruptions. MELTS is a powerful and widely used tool to study the evolution of magmatic systems over a wide spectrum of compositions and conditions. However, the current calibration of MELTS fails to correctly predict the position of the quartz + feldspar saturation surface in temperature, pressure and composition space, making it unsuitable to study silicic systems. We create a modified calibration of MELTS optimized for silicic systems, dubbed rhyolite-MELTS, using early erupted Bishop pumice as a reference. Small adjustments to the calorimetrically determined enthalpy of formation of quartz and of the potassium end-member of alkali feldspar in the MELTS calibration lead to much improved predictions of the quartz + feldspar saturation surface as a function of pressure. Application of rhyolite-MELTS to the Highland Range Volcanic Sequence (Nevada), the Peach Spring Tuff (Arizona–Nevada–California), and the late-erupted Bishop Tuff (California), using compositions that vary from trachydacite to high-silica rhyolite, shows that the calibration is appropriate for a variety of fluid-bearing silicic systems. Some key observations include the following. (1) The simulated evolutionary paths are consistent with petrographic observations and glass compositions; further work is needed to compare predicted and observed mineral compositions. (2) The nearly invariant nature of silicic magmas is well captured by rhyolite-MELTS; unusual behavior is observed after extensive pseudo-invariant crystallization, suggesting that the new calibration works best for relatively small (i.e. \&lt;50 wt \%) crystallization intervals, comparable with what is observed in volcanic rocks. (3) Our success with rhyolite-MELTS shows that water-bearing systems in which hydrous phases do not play a critical role can be appropriately handled; simulations are sensitive to initial water concentration, and although only a pure-H2O fluid is modeled, suitable amounts of water can be added or subtracted to mimic the effect of CO2 in fluid solubility. Our continuing work on natural systems shows that rhyolite-MELTS is very useful in constraining crystallization conditions, and is particularly well suited to explore the eruptive potential of silicic magmas. We show that constraints placed by rhyolite-MELTS simulations using late-erupted Bishop Tuff whole-rock and melt inclusion compositions are inconsistent with a vertically stratified magma body.},

abstract = {The program adiabat\_1ph is a simple text-menu driver for subroutine versions of the algorithms MELTS, pMELTS, and pHMELTS [Asimow et al., 2004; Ghiorso et al., 2002; Ghiorso and Sack, 1995]. It may be used to calculate equilibrium assemblages along a thermodynamic path set by the user and can simultaneously calculate trace element distributions. The MELTS family of algorithms is suitable for multicomponent systems, which may be anhydrous, water-undersaturated, or water-saturated, with the options of buffering oxygen fugacity and/or water activity. A wide variety of calculations can be performed either subsolidus or with liquid(s) present; melting and crystallization may be batch, fractional, or continuous. The software is suitable for Linux, MacOS X, and Windows, and many aspects of program execution are controlled by environment variables. Perl scripts are also provided that may be used to invoke adiabat\_1ph with some command line options and to produce output that may be easily imported into spreadsheet programs, such as Microsoft Excel. Benefits include a batch mode, which allows almost complete automation of the calculation process when suitable input files are written. This technical brief describes version 1.04, which is provided as ancillary material. Binaries, scripts, documentation, and example files for this and future releases may be downloaded at http://www.gps.caltech.edu/∼asimow/adiabat. On a networked computer, adiabat\_1ph automatically checks whether a newer version is available.},

abstract = {Petrogenetic problems including the generation, segregation, ascent, storage, differentiation, contamination, eruption, and solidification of magma to form volcanic and plutonic rocks can only be quantified by artful consideration of the fundamental thermodynamic and transport properties of melts and multiphase magmas. Critically important thermodynamic properties include density, heat capacity, volatile solubility, enthalpy, entropy, and volume of fusion, liquidus temperatures and the variations of all properties with temperature, pressure, and composition. Magma transport is governed by conservation of energy, momentum, and mass that depends on thermal conductivity, shear viscosity, and diffusivity (tracer, chemical and isotopic), and varies with temperature, pressure, composition, phase proportions, and shear rates in complex and interwoven ways. In this chapter magma properties are reviewed in the context of petrogenesis and transport phenomena together with underlying theory. Results are presented both graphically and in tabular form providing a survey across the dominant compositions and conditions relevant to igneous petrology.}

    abstract = {In the last five years, there has been a significant influx of new data in the literature on all aspects of the volumetric properties of silicate liquids. Several studies report 1 bar density measurements on a variety of multicomponent silicate liquids (Lange and Carmichael, 1987, Johnson and Carmichael, 1987; Dingwell and Brearley, 1988; Dingwell et al.,1988; Taniguchi, 1989). As a consequence of these recent data, the controversy surrounding the partial molar volume of Al 2 O 3 in multicomponent silicate liquids (Ghiorso and Carmichael,1984; Bottinga et al., 1984) has been resolved, and the partial molar volumes of Fe 2 O 3 and TiO 2 in natural silicate liquids are now well constrained (although they both exhibit a strong compositional dependence in simple three- and four-component liquids). Perhaps most important, the precision of model equations describing the volume and thermal expansion of natural silicate liquids (Lange and Carmichael, 1987) has increased substantially since the original model of Bottinga and Weill (1970). This has extremely important consequences for the precision of model equations describing the compressibility of natural silicate liquids, since the derivation of compressibility data from both acoustic velocity and shock-wave experiments is critically dependent on accurate 1 bar volume and thermal expansion data. The compressibility of natural silicate liquids can now be readily calculated for any anhydrous composition because of the recent measurements of acoustic velocity in silicate liquids as a systematic function of composition (Rivers and Carmichael, 1987, Kress et al., 1988). These sound speed data have been extended to include Fe 2 O 3 -bearing silicate liquids (Kress and Carmichael, 1991) and allow the ferric component to be incorporated into a general model equation describing the volumes of natural liquids as a function of pressure. Perhaps more important, measurements of the compressibilities of both the ferric and ferrous components in silicate melts provide information on how the ferric-ferrous ratio in a natural liquid changes as a function of pressure. Thus the question of whether or not the redox states of erupted lavas reflect the redox states of their source regions (Carmichael, 1991) can be quantitatively addressed. Both the dynamic shock-wave experiments of Rigden et al. (1984, 1988, 1989) to 250 kbar and the static compression measurements of Agee and Walker (1988) between 10-60 kbar provide information on how the compressibility function itself, for silicate liquids, changes with pressure. These experiments allow direct evaluation of the postulate of Stolper et al. (1981) that olivine will float and coexisting melts will sink at sufficiently high pressures in the Earth's interior. More data obtained by these methods will allow further constraints to be placed on how the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus (KT') changes as a function of composition. Preliminary results indicate that values of KT' are more sensitive to composition than values of KT and that KT' increases (compressibility decreases) as the proportion of initially tetrahedrally coordinated cations (e.g., Al 3 + and Si (super 4+) ) decreases in the liquid (Rigden et al.,1989). The volumetric properties of volatile-bearing silicate liquids have a limited experimental basis. Despite the paucity of direct density measurements of H 2 O- and CO 2 -bearing silicate liquids, thermodynamic analysis of solubility curves for both water and carbon dioxide allows estimation of their partial molar volumes in silicate liquids (Spera and Bergman, 1980; Stolper and Holloway, 1980; Silver et al.,1990). Current estimates are VH 2 O = 20 + or - 5 cc/mole and VCO 2 = 33 + or - 1 cc/mole. Further constraints on the temperature, pressure and compositional dependence of these values are highly desirable. The importance of considering the effect of water and carbon dioxide is easily recognized since both components have a dramatic effect on reducing silicate melt densities. Postulated mechanisms of magmatic differentiation, such as compositionally-induced convection or crystal settling in magma chambers, must consider the effect of water on the density of residual liquids. Not only will the concentration of water in the residual liquid steadily increase as crystallization (of anhydrous phases) proceeds, but small amounts of water can significantly alter the composition, proportion and crystallization temperatures of the phenocryst phases and hence, the bulk composition of the residual liquid. This illustrates the necessity of a thermodynamic model (calibrated on accurate thermodynamic data) that can predict crystal-melt equilibria over a wide range of magmatic conditions in order to quantitatively model the physical aspects of a magma's evolution.},

abstract = {Abstract The knowledge of the cooling time scales of pyroclasts, in conditions of free to forced convection, is of paramount importance in microtextural analysis, development of welded deposits, and in eruption column and pyroclast flow modeling. We performed cooling experiments of heated rock inside a cylindrical wind tunnel under a range of air speeds. In order to estimate the heat transfer coefficients, we modeled the transient temperature distribution in the sample with temperature-dependent thermal diffusivity and heat capacity, which were obtained from laser flash measurements. For air speeds up to 15 m/s and for sample temperatures up to 1383 K (1110 ° C), a Nusselt-Reynolds (Nu-Re) relationship up to Re=3× 104 is established in this study. We find that the dependency of heat loss on size is particularly important for pyroclasts larger than ∼1 mm. Our results suggest that the cooling time scales of pyroclasts could be large enough to cause postfragmentation modification of clast microtextures. We further show that clasts of few-centimeter and larger develop solid crusts with molten cores within time scales of a few minutes and therefore may inhibit postdepositional welding.},

abstract = {The thermal properties of volcanic rocks are crucial to accurately model heat transfer in volcanoes and in geothermal systems located within volcanic deposits. Here we provide laboratory measurements of thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity for variably porous andesites from Mt. Ruapehu (New Zealand) and variably altered basaltic-andesites from Merapi volcano (Indonesia) measured at ambient laboratory pressure and temperature using the transient hot-strip method. The specific heat capacity of each sample was then calculated using these measured values and the bulk sample density. Thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity decrease as a function of increasing porosity, but specific heat capacity does not vary systematically with porosity. For a given porosity, saturation with water increases thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity, but decreases thermal diffusivity. Measurements on samples from Merapi volcano show that, compared to the unaltered samples from Mt. Ruapehu, hydrothermal alteration deceases thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity, and increases specific heat capacity. We use an effective medium approach to parameterise these data, showing that when the porosity and pore-fluid properties are scaled for, the measured values agree well with theoretical predictions. We find that despite the microstructural complexity of the studied andesites, porosity is the principal parameter dictating their thermal properties. To understand whether the measured changes in thermal properties are sufficient to influence natural processes, we model heat transfer from magma to the surrounding host-rock by solving Fick's second law cast in 1D Cartesian (dyke geometry) and cylindrical (conduit geometry) coordinates. We provide models for different host-rock porosities (0–0.6), different initial magmatic temperatures (800–1200 °C), and different levels of host-rock alteration. Our modelling shows how the cooling of a dyke and conduit is slowed by a higher host-rock porosity and by increased hydrothermal alteration. The thermal properties provided herein can help improve modelling designed to inform on volcanic and geothermal processes.}

Understanding the effect of bubbles on the viscous behavior of bubble–melt mixtures over a wide range of bubble volume fractions is essential for accurate modeling of the volcanic processes. In this study, new equations for the relative viscosity of concentrated bubble-bearing suspensions are developed using a differential scheme along with the solution of an infinitely dilute suspension of bubbles. Out of the four models developed in the paper, two models predict the relative viscosity to be a function of only two variables: capillary number and volume fraction of bubbles. There are no adjustable parameters in these models. The remaining two models include an additional parameter, that is, the maximum packing volume fraction of bubbles. The proposed models are evaluated using published numerical and experimental data on the relative viscosity of concentrated suspensions of bubbles. The viscosity models for bubble-bearing suspensions developed in this study are useful in modeling of the volcanic processes.}

abstract = {Bubbles are ubiquitous in magma during eruption and influence the rheology of the suspension. Despite this, bubble-suspension rheology is routinely ignored in conduit-flow and eruption models, potentially impairing accuracy and resulting in the loss of important phenomenological richness. The omission is due, in part, to a historical confusion in the literature concerning the effect of bubbles on the rheology of a liquid. This confusion has now been largely resolved and recently published studies have identified two viscous regimes: in regime 1, the viscosity of the two-phase (magma–gas) suspension increases as gas volume fraction ϕ increases; in regime 2, the viscosity of the suspension decreases as ϕ increases. The viscous regime for a deforming bubble suspension can be determined by calculating two dimensionless numbers, the capillary number Ca and the dynamic capillary number Cd. We provide a didactic explanation of how to include the effect of bubble-suspension rheology in continuum, conduit-flow models. Bubble-suspension rheology is reviewed and a practical rheological model is presented, followed by an algorithmic, step-by-step guide to including the rheological model in conduit-flow models. Preliminary results from conduit-flow models which have implemented the model presented are discussed and it is concluded that the effect of bubbles on magma rheology may be important in nature and results in a decrease of at least 800 m in calculated fragmentation-depth and an increase of between 40% and 250% in calculated eruption-rate compared with the assumption of Newtonian rheology.}

Here we report the results of a series of high-temperature, high-pressure experiments at conditions relevant for volcanic conduits (250 MPa confining pressure and temperature between 500 °C and 900 °C) that were undertaken to investigate the rheology of magma with crystal fractions varying between 0.5 and 0.8 (50 to 80 wt.%) at different strain-rate conditions. The experiments demonstrate that the presence of crystals increases the relative viscosity (ratio between the viscosity of the mixture and the viscosity of the melt phase) of magmas and additionally induces a decrease of the relative viscosity with increasing strain-rate (shear thinning, non-Newtonian behavior). The experimental results, combined with existing data at low crystal fractions (0–0.3), were used to develop a semi-empirical parameterization that describes the variations of relative viscosity for crystal fractions between 0 and 0.8 and accounts for the complex non-Newtonian rheology of crystal-bearing magmas. The new parameterization, included into numerical models simulating the magma ascent dynamics, reveals that strain-rate-dependent rheology significantly modifies the dynamic behavior inside volcanic conduits, particularly affecting the magma fragmentation conditions.}

abstract = {The viscosity of silicate melts controls magma transport dynamics, eruption style and rates of physicochemical processes (e.g., degassing, crystallization) in natural magmas. Thus a comprehensive viscosity model for magmatic liquids has long been a goal of earth scientists. Here we present a model that predicts the non-Arrhenian Newtonian viscosity of silicate melts as a function of T and melt composition, including the rheologically important volatile constituents H2O and F. Our model is based on >1770 measurements of viscosity on multicomponent anhydrous and volatile-rich silicate melts. The non-Arrhenian T-dependence of viscosity is accounted for by the VFT equation [log η=A+B/(T(K)−C)]. The optimization assumes a common, high-T limit (A) for silicate melt viscosity and returns a value for this limit of −4.55 (+0.2) (e.g., log η~10−4.6 Pa s). All compositional dependence is ascribed to the parameters B and C and is accounted for by an additional 17 model coefficients. Our model is continuous in composition- and temperature-space and predicts the viscosity of natural volatile-bearing silicate melts (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, FeOtot, CaO, MgO, MnO, Na2O, K2O, P2O5, H2O, F2O−1) over fifteen log units of viscosity (10−1–1014 Pa s). The model for viscosity can also predict other transport properties including glass transition temperatures (Tg) and melt fragility (m). We show strong systematic decreases in Tg and m with increasing volatile content. This pattern has implications for predicting styles of volcanic eruption and understanding silicate melt structure. Our model transforms a quarter-century of experimental study of melt viscosities, into a parameterisation having a predictive capacity that makes it relevant to diverse fields of research including: volcanology, geophysics, petrology and material sciences.}

abstract = {Abstract Pyroclastic currents are very destructive and their complex behavior makes the related hazards difficult to predict. A new numerical model has been developed to simulate the emplacement of both the concentrated and the dilute parts of pyroclastic currents using two coupled depth-averaged approaches. Interaction laws allow the concentrated current (pyroclastic flow) to generate a dilute current (pyroclastic surge) and, inversely, the dilute current to form a concentrated current or a deposit. The density of the concentrated current is assumed to be constant during emplacement, whereas the density of the dilute current changes depending on the particle supply from the concentrated current and the mass lost through sedimentation. The model is explored theoretically using simplified geometries as proxies for natural source conditions and topographies. It reproduces the relationships observed in the field between the surge genesis and the topography: the increase in surge production in constricted valleys, the decoupling between the concentrated and the dilute currents, and the formation of surge-derived concentrated flows. The strong nonlinear link between the surge genesis and the velocity of the concentrated flow beneath it could explain the sudden occurrence of powerful and destructive surges and the difficulty of predicting this occurrence. A companion paper compares the results of the model with the field data for the eruption of Merapi in 2010 and demonstrates that the approach is able to reproduce the natural emplacement of the concentrated and the dilute pyroclastic currents studied with good accuracy.},

    abstract = {This contribution presents a numerical model of time-dependent physical processes and differentiation in a cooling magma chamber to obtain the magma and liquid composition and model the distribution of minerals and H2O gas bubbles at any moment and place. The numerical experiments were mainly carried out simulating 10 kyr of differentiation of a 50 km3 cylindrical stock-like reservoir as one of the end-members of a wide spectrum of magma body geometries. A detailed space–time distribution of compositional varieties and exsolved phases in a chamber of initially superheated basaltic composition (corresponding to a lava of the Hudson Volcano, Chile) was obtained through numerical simulation using the finite-element method. The roof of the chamber is located at 2 km depth in a crust with a geothermal gradient of 30°C/km. The model considers two spatial directions (z and r) and assumes the magma to be an incompressible non-Newtonian liquid, following the Navier–Stokes formulation, where the density and viscosity depend on the temperature and exsolved solid and volatile phase content, but viscosity also depends on the shear rate. The temperature transfer equation used includes conduction, convection and latent heat. The setting of the model considers that: (1) an extension of 1 km into the country rocks around the chamber imposed on the heat flow across the margins is appropriate; (2) the reaction rates for phase (solid and gas) exsolution correspond to a Gaussian probability function; (3) the involved phases, calibrated from MELTS, are olivine, clinopyroxene, magnetite, plagioclase, orthopyroxene and H2O gas; (4) the velocity of the exsolved phase movements with respect to the hosting liquid is given by the Stokes’ velocity; (5) the sizes of crystals and bubbles in the melt vary in space and time up to a maximum given by the modal crystal size observed in the Hudson Volcano. Our results indicate that the convection dynamics of the reservoir are characterized by three distinct flows of decreasing velocity with time: convective cells, plumes and layer flows along the walls. The along-wall magma flow, which persists during most of the 10 kyr of magma cooling, contributes to the thermal insulation of the chamber interior, giving rise to a nearly permanent coexistence of liquids of contrasting composition. A strong compositional stratification is generated in the upper half of the chamber, with a downward-increasing thickness of layers. Such stratification is mainly the result of continuous upward flow and storage on top of the sidewall residual melts. The lower half of the chamber exhibits an independent convective pattern dominated by ascending plumes. A less pronounced stratification is generated here as a consequence of mixing between the residual liquid in the ascending plumes and the surrounding melt. Crystal accumulations of olivine, clinopyroxene and magnetite at the bottom generate a significant volume of ultrabasic magma at the end of 10 kyr. A plagioclase-rich solidification front along the walls is formed during the last stages of crystallization, when the along-wall magma flow diminishes in velocity. An application of the numerical modeling to a cylindrical sill-like chamber is presented to emphasize the role of the aspect ratio in the magma fluid dynamics, compositional gradients and exsolved phase distribution. The stock-like chamber favors the formation of steep compositional gradients and H2O gas concentration at the roof. Concentration of the exsolved phases along the margins is favored in a sill-like chamber. From the simulation results, it is possible to infer that stock-like chambers would be more eruptible and would exhibit a wider compositional spectrum of eruptive materials than sill-like chambers. Because solid and liquid dispersion follow different patterns in a convective chamber, the record of crystal–liquid equilibrium would be an exception.},

    abstract = {Water is an essential component of rhyolitic magmas and nearly universally, silicic magmatism in the upper crust includes a transition from magma to water-saturated roof rocks. We have numerically simulated the effect of the addition of geothermal fluids to an intruded rhyolitic sill from the hydrothermal system contained within the porous felsitic roof rocks. Water uptake in the melt proceeds via its thermodynamically estimated saturation with a partial melt, corresponding to the fugacity of hydrothermal water in the melt-fluid zone at particular T–P-\$\{X\}\_\{H\_2O\}\$ conditions. It is assumed that the exchange occurs until the melt fraction increases to the threshold melt fraction value εb ≈ 0.3–0.45. In this approximation, the amount of added water is the product of its solubility and the critical melt fraction εb. In two series of numerical experiments run at pressures of 200 and 50 MPa, the interaction of water-filled porous felsite with near liquidus rhyolite magma resulted in water absorption, induced partial melting creating a narrow several meters wide mushy zone, and sluggish convection below that distributed water across the intruded sill. At P = 200 MPa, the addition of about 1.5 wt\% water results in stronger volume convection, causing the melting rate to increase to 20 m/year. However, the addition of \&lt;0.22 wt\% water induced no melting on the magma/contact mush interface, and the intruded sill crystallizes without convection. We apply the results of these numerical experiments to hot and dry rhyolites of the Yellowstone hot spot track magmas and then to the 2009 AD rhyolite sampled by the IDDP-1 exploration well in Krafla (Iceland). An active contact between the hydrothermal system within felsite and hot 963°C rhyolite magma was accidentally crossed at the depth of 2100 m, with a very thin (\&lt;30 m) transition providing information for a partial verification of our theoretical model. With the parameters observed in 2009, including the water concentrations in the melt (1.8 wt\%) and felsite (0.92 wt\%) and the high temperature of the intruded magma (945°C–980°C), we obtained slow melting of the preheated felsite roof at a rate of about 1 m/year. This seems reasonable if the 2009 magma was intruded during the 1975–1984 Krafla Fires eruption. We additionally present new δD values (−118‰) and H2Otot (1.6–2.0 wt\%) concentration and reinterpret published δD and H2Otot values for felsitic fragments from IDDP-1; we find these to be lower than the δD in the mantle-derived magmas or hydrothermal systems. We demonstrate that, in theory, the formation of a fluid with such a low δD can be provided by the addition of low-δD water from OH-bearing minerals in hydrothermally altered roof rock. This may happen during dehydration of epidote from the altered roof rocks, and, alternatively, may also proceed by the mechanism of thermal diffusion (the Soret effect) through the partially molten/hydrothermal transition zone controlled by fluid fugacity. The high-temperature gradient in the contact zone between magma and the geothermal system of about 15–17°/m with conditions at the cold end close to the critical point for the aqueous fluid further decreases the expected δD value at the hot end of the contact zone to less than −110‰.},

abstract = {Large and small volume rhyolites are generated in calderas and rift zones, inheriting older and isotopically diverse crystal populations from their volcanic predecessors. Low-δ18O values in many of these rhyolites suggest that they were derived from the remelting of solid, hydrothermally altered by meteoric water protoliths that were once close to the surface, but become buried by caldera collapse or rifting. These rhyolites persist for millions of years in these environments with little evidence of coeval basalts. We present a series of numerical experiments on convective melting of roof-rocks by the underplated by near liquidus to superheated silicic melts, generated at the base of the chamber by basaltic intrusions in shallow crustal conditions. We used a range of temperatures and compositions, an appropriate phase diagram with a defined extended eutectic zone appropriate for these environments, varied sill thickness, viscosity of the boundary layer, and considered hydrothermal and lower boundary heat losses. The goal was to estimate melting rates and mechanisms, define conditions that are required for efficient and rapid remelting in the upper crust, quantitatively describe novel details of the dynamics of convecting melting, and compare it to the earlier parametric and numerical treatments of roof melting by underplating. Resolution of numerical experiments allowed us to track mixed thermal and two-phase plume-like convection in silicic magma with a bulk viscosity of 104.5–105.5Pas. The following results were obtained: (1) remarkably fast melting/magma generation rates of many meters per year, (2) intrinsic inhomogeneities in the roof accelerates convection and melting rates via rapid gravitational settling of refractory blocks and exposing detachment scars to the melting front, (3) due to rapid melting, hydrothermal heat loss through the roof, and conductive heat dissipation through the bottom are less important on melting timescales. (4) Convective melting is capable of digesting cold roof-rocks, with high assimilation degrees, which are primarily controlled by sill thickness and roof-rock temperature: thin 10m sills are able to digest 40% of the initially hot roof-rock T=650°C roof-rock, but>100m sills achieve the same level of bulk digestion with T=400°C roof-rocks. The proposed model can explain the origin of hot (above 800–850°C), crystal-poor, “recycled” rhyolites in calderas and rift zones. It can also explain the generation of large, supervolcanic rhyolite volumes through remelting of their erupted and subvolcanic predecessors on rapid timescales, dictated by their zoned and disequilibrium crystalline cargo.}

The main thrust of the IDDP is to develop deep supercritical systems, but an unexpected encounter with a shallow body of magma demonstrated that very high power outputs are also possible from the contact zone of an intrusion. In the future it may be feasible to produce energy directly from magma. Favorable environments to implement these concepts are likely worldwide wherever active volcanoes and young volcanic rocks occur.}

    abstract = {Dyke propagation is a mechanism for more rapid ascent of felsic magmas through the crust than is possible via diapirs or percolative flow. As it ascends, the magma undergoes complex physical and chemical transformations induced by decompression and cooling. These processes dramatically change the magma density and viscosity, which in turn affect magma ascent rate and the depth at which the dyke arrests. We present a mathematical model of dyke propagation for silicic magmas taking into account the presence of multiple volatile species (H2O and CO2), bubble growth, heat advection and loss, crystallization and latent heat release. We consider conditions for dykes associated with porphyry ore deposits, which may represent an end-member in rapid ascent of felsic magmas from depth. In particular, we simulate the propagation of dykes launched from a deep (900 MPa), volatile-saturated magma source, testing the effects of the magma H2O/CO2 content, temperature and mass on its ascent rate and final emplacement depth. The model predicts short ascent times (hours to days), with a large increase in viscosity at shallow depth, leading to stagnation and solidification of the dyke. Higher initial water content, higher temperature and larger mass of the magma in the dyke promote faster propagation and shallower arrest. Volatile loss from ascending magma remains limited until the stagnation depth, providing a potential mechanism for transfer of deep volatiles to hypabyssal blind intrusions associated with porphyry ore deposits. Our findings are applicable to the problem of silicic magma ascent through the crust more generally.},

Hydroxyl contents determined from near-IR spectroscopy range from ~ 0 to 70 ppm as H2O. Two directions constrain D for clinopyroxenes, consistent with phonon symmetry. Anisotropy = (D⊥c −D||c)/D||c is near 40 \% for all samples and independent of T, where || and ⊥ indicate the direction heat flows relative to the c-axis. Thermal diffusivity decreases with increasing T and approaches a constant (Dsat) near 1400 K. The temperature dependence of 1/D is well described by low-order polynomial fits. At 298 K and for near end-member compositions, cation mass and bond lengths strongly affect D⊥c whereas D||c is essentially constant and large, 3.9 mm2 s−1.

Synthetic disordered spinel, 4 gemstones near MgAl2O4, nearly ZnAl2O4, 4 “hercynites” [(Mg,Fe2+)(Al,Fe3+)2O4], and 2 magnetites (nearly Fe3O4) were characterized using optical spectroscopy and electron microprobe analysis. The magnetic transition in Fe3O4 is manifest as a lambda curve in 1/D, but otherwise, D decreases with increasing T and approaches a constant (Dsat) at high T. Part of the decrease in D as T increases results from disordering above ~700 K: these two effects were distinguished by making multiple heating runs. At 298 K, D decreases strongly as either cation substitution or Mg-Al disorder increases, whereas Dsat is moderately perturbed by substitutions. For both ordered and (equilibrium) disordered spinels and hercynites, the temperature dependence of 1/D is best described by low-order polynomial fits. For spinel, combining our data with previous cryogenic studies of thermal conductivity (k) constrains the T dependence of D and k from ~0 K to melting.The response of D to disorder, impurity content, and cation mass for the aluminates is used to constrain D(T) for γ-Mg2SiO4 and ringwoodite. Pressure derivatives are provided by relationships such as ∂ln(klat)/∂P = ∂ln(KT)/∂P.

The pervasive generation of compositional gaps influences the mechanical and thermal properties of the crust, and holds clues on how our planet differentiates. We have explored potential mechanisms to generate these gaps using numerical simulations coupling crystallization kinetics and multiphase fluid dynamics of magma reservoirs. We show that gaps are inherent to crystal fractionation for all compositions, as crystal-liquid separation takes place most efficiently within a crystallinity window of ∼50–70 vol\% crystals. The probability of melt extraction from a crystal residue in a cooling magma chamber is highest in this crystallinity window due to (1) enhanced melt segregation in the absence of chamber-wide convection, (2) buffering by latent heat of crystallization, and (3) diminished chamber-wall thermal gradients. This mechanical control of igneous distillation is likely to have played a dominant role in the formation of the compositionally layered Earth's crust by allowing multiple and overlapping intrusive episodes of relatively discrete or quantized composition that become more silicic upward.},

abstract = {We present a combined multiphase numerical and crystal-tracking approach that provides a framework to investigate the transport and zoning of crystals associated with a gas-driven mixing event. Mixing in compositionally intermediate to silicic magmatic systems is often initiated by gas exsolution in the recharging magma, causing a density inversion and subsequent overturn. The overturn is simulated for a range of bubble volume fractions ɛbubbles and therefore indirectly for a range of Reynolds numbers Re. All simulations show chaotic flow dynamics with fast overturn timescales of minutes to hours. The large-scale mixing is inefficient during a single overturn, resulting in a continuously stratified system with respect to bubble volume fraction. The crystal-tracking algorithm provides us with information on the small scales, i.e., 10 cm. On this length scale we observe gathering of different crystals during the overturn that typically ranges on the order of tens of meters. Thus, a complex crystal population may arise within a single overturn. This gathering and dispersal of crystals is strongest and most uniform for high Re. For low Re, crystal populations are characterized by less gathering of crystals that originated from distal portions of the magma body. During the overturn the crystals pass through environments of changing chemical potential. We apply the Damköhler number Da, which compares the crystallization or dissolution to the advection timescale. Results show an asymmetry between crystallization and dissolution. Crystallization times are too slow during gas-driven overturn to record transient changes in chemical potential. Crystals most likely only record their initial as well as their final chemical environment. In contrast, dissolution and advection rates are of similar order, suggesting potential dissolution during the overturn. On the basis of the results for gas-driven overturn we expect that slower physical mixing processes may be continuously recorded in the zonation pattern of the crystal phases as long as the changes in chemical potential produce crystal growth.},

The granular viscosity calculation is sensitive to particle size and three particle sizes were considered: 0.0002 m, 0.002 m, and 0.02 m. A critical volume fraction of gas (0.75) identifies the onset of fragmentation, dividing the region of rhyolitic magma with dispersed bubbles from the region of turbulent gas with dispersed particles. The transient simulations can be divided into two dynamic regimes: an initial shock followed by a transition to steady state. During the initial shock phase, treatment of the granular pressure and viscosity led to greater particle velocities relative to the inviscid calculation due to the development of higher gas pressure at fragmentation. However, as steady state is approached the viscosity slows the particle phase relative to the inviscid counterpart for particles greater than a millimeter. The modeled sub-millimeter particle velocity was insensitive to the treatment of the granular pressure and viscosity. Centimeter-scale particles have a much higher granular viscosity (up to 10−1 Pa·s) and the kinetic theory calculation is thus relevant in these conditions. After reaching steady state, the differential velocity between gas and particles at the conduit exit correlates with particle size for both the inviscid and granular viscosity calculations: negligible differential velocity develops for sub-millimeter particles, but centimeter-scale particles exit the conduit with >5% differential velocity between phases.}

Following validity and verification tests of the model, we carried out four single-phase and three bi-phase numerical 30-year- simulations, in an idealized 2D geometry representing a lava lake cooled from above and a reservoir heated from below that are linked by a 4-to-10–m-diameter conduit. We tested the effects of crystals on convection while changing conduit size and the system boundaries from closed to open. Neglecting crystal settling yields only a limited number of features, i.e., (i) the formation of a central instability, (ii) the average temperature evolution, and (iii) the average velocity range of the surface flow motion. Bi-phase simulations show that while crystals are quite efficiently transported by the liquid phase a small decoupling reflecting their large size (5 cm) results in settling. This leads to more complex circulation patterns and enhances the vigor of fluid motion. A sufficiently large conduit sustains convection and retains 6 and 20\% of crystals in suspension, for a closed and open system, respectively. Model outputs do not yet correspond well with field observations of Erebus lava lake (e.g., real surface velocities are much faster than those modeled), suggesting that exsolved volatiles are an important source of buoyancy.},

Although no systematic study has investigated the numerical properties of the method, numerous applications have shown its robustness and flexibility for the study of large viscous deformations. The model setups used in geodynamics often involve large smooth variations of viscosity (e.g., temperature-dependent viscosity) as well large discontinuous variations in material properties (e.g., material interfaces). Establishing the numerical properties of the FD-MIC and showing that the scheme is convergent adds relevance to the applications studies that employ this method. In this study, we numerically investigate the discretization errors and order of accuracy of the velocity and pressure solution obtained from the FD-MIC scheme using two-dimensional analytic solutions. We show that, depending on which type of boundary condition is used, the FD-MIC scheme is a second-order accurate in space as long as the viscosity field is constant or smooth (i.e., continuous). With the introduction of a discontinuous viscosity field characterized by a viscosity jump (η*) within the control volume, the scheme becomes first-order accurate. We observed that the transition from second-order to first-order accuracy will occur with only a small increase in the viscosity contrast (η* ≈ 5). We have employed two methods for projecting the material properties from the Lagrangian markers onto the Eulerian nodes. The methods are based on the size of the interpolation volume (4-cell, 1-cell). The use of a more local interpolation scheme (1-cell) decreases the absolute velocity and pressure discretization errors. We also introduce a stabilization algorithm that damps the potential oscillations that may arise from quasi free surface calculations in numerical codes that employ the strong form of the Stokes equations. This correction term is of particular interest for topographic modeling, since the surface of the Earth is generally represented by a free surface. Including the stabilization enables physically meaningful solutions to be obtained from our simulations, even in cases where the time step value exceeds the isostatic relaxation time. We show that including the stabilization algorithm in our FD stencil does not affect the convergence properties of our scheme. In order to verify our approach, we performed time-dependent simulations of free surface Rayleigh-Taylor instability.},

abstract = {Abstract GPS measurements spanning 2008 to 2014 are used to derive the surface velocity field across the Northern Volcanic Zone (NVZ) of Iceland, a subaerial part of the divergent boundary between the North American and Eurasian plates. No volcanic activity nor magmatic intrusions were detected in the zone during this time period. We infer an extensional rate of 17.4 mm/yr in direction 292.0 °, consistent with the results of previous studies and current plate motion models including MORVEL2010 and GEODVEL2010. The horizontal velocity field reveals about 50 km wide stretching zone caused by the divergent plate movements. Glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) induces uplift of over 20 mm/yr at the northern edge of Vatnajökull ice cap and 3–4 mm/yr horizontal motion directed away from the ice cap. Deformation in the NVZ between 2008 and 2014 can be reproduced by a combination of models relating to several different processes: (i) Mogi sources for volcanic and geothermal deformation at the Askja and Krafla volcanoes, (ii) scaled version of a velocity field derived from a glacial isostatic model, and (iii) simple arctangent-based model for secular plate spreading. We find the approximate location of the plate boundary spreading axis as well as its locking depth. The spreading axis lies through the Krafla, Fremrinámar, and Askja central volcanoes, the most active ones in the NVZ. It does not appear to follow the general direction of each fissure swarm but rather to change direction at the central volcanoes. The locking depth is on average within the 7–9 km range.},

abstract = {Detailed study of rates and extent of ground deformation during and following the September 1984 eruption of the Krafla volcano, northeast Iceland, revealed the existence of several reservoirs that feed magma towards the volcano. A shallow magma reservoir - the Krafla magma reservoir - appears to be centered 2.6 km below the central part of the Krafla caldera. Three additional magma reservoirs, each displaying its own characteristic flow behavior, feed magma into the shallow reservoir. Reservoir I supplied very rapid flow during and immediately after the eruption. Reservoir II was the dominant supplier of magma 3 weeks to 4 months after the beginning of the 2 week long eruption. Reservoir III had dominated the supply of magma to the shallow reservoir for two years prior to the eruption. Reservoir I lies at a depth of less than 10 km and may be regarded as a smaller downward continuation of the shallow Krafla reservoir. Reservoir II appears to be deeper than 20 km and to have a volume roughly 5 times that of the shallow reservoir. Reservoir III lies at an indetermined depth, and its volume is immense. The Krafla volcano started to deflate at about 20h20 on September 4, 1984, and the eruption commenced at 23h49 and continued until September 18. The lava covered a 24-km2 area, and its volume can be roughly estimated as 108 m3. About 20 million m3 of magma were emplaced as a dike, one meter thick and 8.5 km long, below the eruptive fissure. The deflation of the volcano as measured by the volume of the subsidence bowl, shows that 60–80 million m3 of magma escaped from the shallow magma reservoir immediately before and during the eruption.}

Images are processed using the COSI-Corr software package. Surface extension is accommodated on normal faults and fissures which bound the rift zone, in response to dike injection at depth. Correlation of declassified KH-9 spy and SPOT5 satellite images reveals extension between 1977–2002 (2.5 m average opening over 80 km), while correlation of aerial photos between 1957–1990 provide measurements of the total extension (average 4.3 m opening over 80 km). Our results show ∼8 m of opening immediately north of Krafla caldera, decreasing to 3–4 m at the northern end of the rift. Correlation of aerial photos from 1957–1976 reveal a bi-modal pattern of opening along the rift during the early crisis, which may indicate either two different magma sources located at either end of the rift zone (a similar pattern of opening was observed in the 2005 Afar rift crisis in East Africa), or variations in rock strength along the rift. Our results provide new information on how past dike injection events accommodate long-term plate spreading, as well as providing more details on the Krafla rift crisis. This study also highlights the potential of optical image correlation using inexpensive declassified spy satellite and aerial photos to measure deformation of the Earth's surface going back many decades, thus providing a new tool for measuring Earth surface dynamics, e.g. glaciers, landsliding, coastal erosion, volcano monitoring and earthquake studies, when InSAR and GPS data are not available.},

abstract = {The 1975–1984 Krafla Fires in northeast Iceland was the first plate-boundary rifting episode to be tracked using seismic and geodetic monitoring. Geophysical observations from this episode have inspired conceptual models of magma transport during plate spreading, but a lack of complementary petrologic insights has hindered a holistic understanding of the events. To address this knowledge gap, we studied the petrochemistry of all nine Krafla Fires basaltic eruptions. Our large dataset of new whole-rock, matrix glass and mineral analyses from samples collected during or shortly after each eruption reveal a clear compositional bimodality in the erupted magmas that persisted across the episode, with evolved quartz tholeiite (MgO = 5.7–6.4 wt.%) erupted inside Krafla caldera, and more primitive (usually olivine-normative) tholeiite (MgO = 6.4–8.7 wt%) erupted north of the caldera margin. Barometric calculations indicate tapping of these magmas from distinct reservoirs: a primitive lower-crustal reservoir at a most probable depth of ∼14–19 km, and a more evolved, shallower reservoir at a most probable depth of ∼7–9 km beneath the caldera. These reservoirs were tapped simultaneously in several of the nine eruptions, and in three events the two magma types mixed near the northern caldera margin. Varying levels of trace element depletion in the deep-sourced primitive melts reflect incomplete mixing of diverse mantle-derived melts at depth; the most enriched of these melts could be parental to evolved inside-caldera magma via fractional crystallization. Clinopyroxene rims on gabbroic nodules from primitive September 1984 lavas record lower crustal pressures, while diffusion models suggest that these rims grew up to within a few months before eruption. Ascent of the primitive magma from the lower crust thus occurred over timescales much shorter than eruptive repose periods, without prolonged stalling at shallow depths. These observations are inconsistent with the view that the eruptions were entirely fed by lateral magma outflow from the shallow reservoir. They instead require some decoupling of the flow paths of the two magma types: the primitive magma either bypassed the sub-caldera reservoir laterally or ascended vertically beneath the northern vents. The two reservoirs nonetheless shared a hydraulic connection and jointly responded to rifting. Comparison of the Krafla Fires with other rifting events and eruptions highlights the complexity and diversity of magma transport during plate boundary rifting events, which is not yet captured by a generalizable model. Integration of petrologic, geochemical and geophysical data is essential to provide a holistic view of future rifting events in Iceland and at other spreading centres.}

abstract = {Abstract The Krafla area in north Iceland hosts a high-temperature geothermal system within a volcanic caldera. Temperature measurements from boreholes drilled for power generation reveal enigmatic contrasts throughout the drilled area. While wells in the western part of the production field indicate a 0.5–1 km thick near-isothermal (∼210°C) liquid-dominated reservoir underlain by a deeper boiling reservoir, wells in the east indicate boiling conditions extending from the surface to the maximum depth of drilled wells (∼2 km). Understanding these systematic temperature contrasts in terms of the subsurface permeability structure has remained challenging. Here, we present a new numerical model of the natural, pre-exploitation state of the Krafla system, incorporating a new geologic/conceptual model and a version of TOUGH2 extending to supercritical conditions. The model shows how the characteristic temperature distribution results from structural partitioning of the system by a rift-parallel eruptive fissure and an aquitard at the transition between deeper basement intrusions and high-permeability extrusive volcanic rocks. As model calibration is performed using a Bayesian framework, the posterior results reveal significant uncertainty in the inferred permeability values for the different rock types, often exceeding two orders of magnitude. While the model shows how zones of single-phase supercritical vapor develop above the deep intrusive heat source, more data from deep wells is needed to better constrain the extent and temperature of the deep supercritical zones. However, the model suggests the presence of a significant untapped resource at Krafla.},

    abstract = {When basalt magmas are emplaced into continental crust, melting and generation of silicic magma can be expected. The fluid dynamical and heat transfer processes at the roof of a basaltic sill in which the wall rock melts are investigated theoretically and also experimentally using waxes and aqueous solutions. At the roof, the low density melt forms a stable melt layer with negligible mixing with the underlying hot liquid. A quantitative theory for the roof melting case has been developed. When applied to basalt sills in hot crust, the theory predicts that basalt sills of thicknesses from 10 to 1500 m require only 1 to 270 y to solidify and would form voluminous overlying layers of convecting silicic magma. For example, for a 500 m sill with a crustal melting temperature of 850 °C, the thickness of the silicic magma layer generated ranges from 300 to 1000 m for country rock temperatures from 500 to 850°C. The temperatures of the crustal melt layers at the time that the basalt solidifies are high (900–950°C) so that the process can produce magmas representing large degrees of partial fusion of the crust. Melting occurs in the solid roof and the adjacent thermal boundary layer, while at the same time there is crystallization in the convecting interior. Thus the magmas formed can be highly porphyritic. Our calculations also indicate that such magmas can contain significant proportions of restite crystals. Much of the refractory components of the crust are dissolved and then re-precipitated to form genuine igneous phenocrysts. Normally zoned plagioclase feldspar phenocrysts with discrete calcic cores are commonly observed in many granitoids and silicic volcanic rocks. Such patterns would be expected in crustal melting, where simultaneous crystallization is an inevitable consequence of the fluid dynamics.The time-scales for melting and crystallization in basalt-induced crustal melting (102−103 y) are very short compared to the lifetimes of large silicic magma systems (\&gt;106 y) or to the time-scale for thermal relaxation of the continental crust (\&gt; l07 y). Several of the features of silicic igneous systems can be explained without requiring large, high-level, long-lived magma chambers. Cycles of mafic to increasingly large volumes of silicic magma with time are commonly observed in many systems. These can be interpreted as progressive heating of the crust until the source region is partially molten and basalt can no longer penetrate. Every input of basalt triggers rapid formation of silicic magma in the source region. This magma will freeze again in time-scales of order l02−103 y unless it ascends to higher levels. Crystallization can occur in the source region during melting, and eruption of porphyritic magmas does not require a shallow magma chamber, although such chambers may develop as magma is intruded into high levels in the crust. For typical compositions of upper crustal rocks, the model predicts that dacitic volcanic rocks and granodiorite/tonalite plutons would be the dominant rock types and that these would ascend-from the source region and form magmas ranging from those with high temperature and low crystal content to those with high crystal content and a significant proportion of restite.},

    abstract = {A model for the generation of intermediate and silicic igneous rocks is presented, based on experimental data and numerical modelling. The model is directed at subduction-related magmatism, but has general applicability to magmas generated in other plate tectonic settings, including continental rift zones. In the model mantle-derived hydrous basalts emplaced as a succession of sills into the lower crust generate a deep crustal hot zone. Numerical modelling of the hot zone shows that melts are generated from two distinct sources; partial crystallization of basalt sills to produce residual H2O-rich melts; and partial melting of pre-existing crustal rocks. Incubation times between the injection of the first sill and generation of residual melts from basalt crystallization are controlled by the initial geotherm, the magma input rate and the emplacement depth. After this incubation period, the melt fraction and composition of residual melts are controlled by the temperature of the crust into which the basalt is intruded. Heat and H2O transfer from the crystallizing basalt promote partial melting of the surrounding crust, which can include meta-sedimentary and meta-igneous basement rocks and earlier basalt intrusions. Mixing of residual and crustal partial melts leads to diversity in isotope and trace element chemistry. Hot zone melts are H2O-rich. Consequently, they have low viscosity and density, and can readily detach from their source and ascend rapidly. In the case of adiabatic ascent the magma attains a super-liquidus state, because of the relative slopes of the adiabat and the liquidus. This leads to resorption of any entrained crystals or country rock xenoliths. Crystallization begins only when the ascending magma intersects its H2O-saturated liquidus at shallow depths. Decompression and degassing are the driving forces behind crystallization, which takes place at shallow depth on timescales of decades or less. Degassing and crystallization at shallow depth lead to large increases in viscosity and stalling of the magma to form volcano-feeding magma chambers and shallow plutons. It is proposed that chemical diversity in arc magmas is largely acquired in the lower crust, whereas textural diversity is related to shallow-level crystallization.},

A general class of models (Energy Conserved-RAFC or EC-RAFC) can be constructed, which allow simulation of geochemical paths for trace elements and isotopic ratios for magma undergoing simultaneous replenishment, assimilation and fractional crystallization during the approach to thermal equilibration. The general problem of EC-RAFC is formulated as a set of 3 + t + i + s coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations, where the number of trace elements, radiogenic and stable isotope ratios simultaneously modeled are t, i and s, respectively. Partial melting of wallrock, modeled as fractional melting, is incorporated, as are sensible and latent heat effects. Temperature-dependent partition coefficients are used to describe trace element distributions. Solution of the set of differential equations, with magma temperature ( Tm ) as the independent variable, provides values for the average temperature of wallrock ( Ta ), fraction of melt within the magma body ( Mm ), mass of cumulates ( Mc ) formed, mass of wallrock involved in the thermal interaction ( Ma°), mass of anatectic melt assimilated ( Ma*), the concentration of t trace elements (Cm ) and i + s isotopic ratios (εm) in magma (melt plus cumulates) and in anatectic melt delivered to the evolving magma body. Input parameters include a user-defined equilibration temperature ( Teq ), the initial temperatures and compositions of magma, recharge magma, and wallrock, distribution coefficients and their temperature dependences, heats of fusion and crystallization, and isobaric specific heat capacities of the various constituents. For a priori defined magma recharge mass and Teq, the mass of wallrock heated to Teq is computed and the geochemical trajectory of melt is determined as magma temperature approaches Teq from its starting value, Tm°. The effects of imperfect extraction of anatectic wallrock melt may be accounted for by introduction of an extraction efficiency factor. Mathematical details of a simpler model, EC-AFC (no replenishment) are provided. Energy-constrained models have the advantage of linking thermal and chemical properties of magma chambers. Compared with ‘classical’ models that conserve mass and species only, they represent more complete assessments of the complex physicochemical dynamics governing the geochemical evolution of open-system magma bodies. Results of EC-AFC simulations demonstrate that geochemical trends can differ significantly from predictions based on ‘classical’ AFC even when recharge plays no role. Incorporation of energy conservation and partial melting into geochemical models allows important coupled effects to play their natural role.},

    abstract = {Compositional gaps are common in volcanic series worldwide. The pervasive generation of compositional gaps influences the mechanical and thermal properties of the crust, and holds clues on how our planet differentiates. We have explored potential mechanisms to generate these gaps using numerical simulations coupling crystallization kinetics and multiphase fluid dynamics of magma reservoirs. We show that gaps are inherent to crystal fractionation for all compositions, as crystal-liquid separation takes place most efficiently within a crystallinity window of ∼50–70 vol\% crystals. The probability of melt extraction from a crystal residue in a cooling magma chamber is highest in this crystallinity window due to (1) enhanced melt segregation in the absence of chamber-wide convection, (2) buffering by latent heat of crystallization, and (3) diminished chamber-wall thermal gradients. This mechanical control of igneous distillation is likely to have played a dominant role in the formation of the compositionally layered Earth's crust by allowing multiple and overlapping intrusive episodes of relatively discrete or quantized composition that become more silicic upward.},

abstract = {Equations describing trace element and isotopic evolution in a magma chamber affected simultaneously by fractional crystallization and wallrock assimilation are presented for a model where the mass assimilation rate(Ṁa) is an arbitrary fraction(r) of the fractional crystallization rate(Ṁc). The equations also apply to recharge of a crystallizing magma. Relatively simple analytical expressions are obtained for both radiogenic isotope variations (Nd, Sr, Pb) and stable isotopes (O, H) including the effects of mass-dependent fractionation. Forr = 1 a modified zone refining equation is obtained for trace element concentrations, but forr < 1 behavior is a combination of zone refining and fractional crystallization. Asr → ∞, simple binary mixing is approached. The isotopic and trace element “mixing” trends generated can be much different from binary mixing, especially forr < 1. The model provides the basis for a more general approach to the problem of wallrock assimilation, and shows that binary mixing models are insufficient to rule out crustal assimilation as a cause of some of the isotopic variations observed in igneous rocks, including cases where clustering of isotopic values occurs partway between presumed endmember values. The coupled assimilation-fractional crystallization model provides an explanation for certain trace element and isotopic properties of continental margin orogenic magmas (e.g. Sr concentration versus87Sr/86Sr) which had previously been interpreted as evidence against assimilation. So-called “pseudoisochrons” can be understood as artifacts of contamination using this model. A significant correlation exists between country rock age and low143Nd/144Nd ratios in continental igneous rocks, clearly suggestive that crustal contamination is generally important.}

    abstract = {The physical process of crystal-melt separation is responsible for the accumulation of small to very large volumes (\&gt;100 km3) of eruptible rhyolitic melt in the shallow crust. Granitic intrusions, although providing a terminal, time-integrated image of melt segregation processes, host an unmatched record of the physical properties controlling mechanisms and rates of interstitial melt extraction from a crystal-rich source. We applied mass balance calculations and thermodynamic modeling simulations to an extensive bulk rock geochemistry dataset (\&gt;150 samples) collected in a Permian upper-crustal granitoid intrusion of the Italian Southern Alps. Textural and geochemical evidence indicate that this intrusion constituted a single, zoned magma body, with a crystal-rich base and a thick (~2 km), high-silica cap (75–77 wt\% SiO₂). The large compositional variability of the crystal-rich materials suggests variable degrees of melt extraction efficiency and corresponding terminal porosities. Specifically, the loosely bimodal distribution of porosity values (φ) indicates that at least two distinct melt segregation mechanisms were operating in this system, which produced both high (0.65–0.45) and low terminal porosities (0.45–0.25) in the crystal-rich, cumulate materials. Modeling of latent heat budget shows that coexistence of cumulate products with differing terminal porosity signature can be explained by melt segregation processes taking place at different depths across a thick, interconnected magmatic reservoir with an initial homogenous water content (~4 wt\% H2O). Deep in the mush column, low water activities (aH₂O \&lt; 0.5) promoted thermal buffering of cooling magma at high crystallinities, enabling residual melt extraction by percolation through a crystalline framework accompanied by compaction. Instead, at shallower depths, high water activities (aH₂O \&gt; 0.5) ensured prolonged magma residence at porosities that promoted crystal melt separation via hindered settling. Distinct melt extraction processes, acting synchronously but at different depths in vertically extensive silicic mush columns, can account for the large volumes of residual, haplogranitic melt mobilized during the relatively short lifespan of upper crustal magma reservoirs (~105 years).},

    abstract = {New compositional profiles across plagioclase grains from the Layered Series (LS), Marginal Border Series (MBS) and Upper Border Series (UBS) of the Skaergaard intrusion are used to understand the mechanisms of cumulate rock solidification and the fate of the interstitial liquid. The data show that plagioclase crystals display three types of compositional profile over the whole intrusion, as follows. (1) Grains with normal zoning, which dominate the MBS and UBS. These are interpreted as having formed at the top of a crystal mush and then buried in the cumulate pile. Crystallization of the interstitial melt resulted in liquid differentiation and produced normally zoned rims on plagioclase cores. (2) Unzoned crystals, which dominate the upper part of the LS, also crystallized at the top of the mush and were then buried in mush with a low interstitial liquid fraction or one experiencing convective movements that kept the liquid to a constant composition. (3) Crystals with a mantle of decreasing An content followed by a rim of constant composition. Grains showing this complex zoning mostly occur in the lower parts of the LS. Depending on the stratigraphic position within the intrusion, the composition of the rim can be An56, An51 or An40. In the main magma body, these compositions (An contents) correspond to those of plagioclase primocrysts (e.g. cores) at the appearance of cumulus clinopyroxene (An56), Fe–Ti oxides (An51) and apatite (An40). Compositional buffering of plagioclase rims is interpreted as being a consequence of enhanced release of latent heat of crystallization at the appearance of new interstitial phases in the crystal mush. When a new phase saturates, the latent heat contribution to the global enthalpy budget of the system becomes sufficiently high to keep the interstitial melt at its liquidus temperature for a period of time that could exceed thousands of years. Under these conditions, equilibrium, adcumulus growth together with diffusion and possibly advection of chemical components result in the formation of plagioclase rims of constant composition (An content). Efficient thermal buffering of the mush liquid depends on the porosity (i.e. fraction of liquid within the mush) and the degree of compositional homogeneity of the mush. In a heterogeneous and highly porous mush, saturation of the new phase occurs in the coldest part of the mush and the enhanced latent heat release at the saturation of this phase is quickly dissipated to the whole volume of liquid, including the warmest part that is not yet saturated in a new phase. As a consequence, no thermal buffering occurs and interstitial crystallization produces grains with normal zoning. The distribution of the various types of plagioclase grains throughout the Skaergaard intrusion can therefore be used to infer the spatial variability in the physical properties of the crystal mush, such as the residual porosity, both at an intrusion-wide scale and at a millimetre- to centimetre-scale.},

ABSTRACT={<p>We have constrained syneruptive pressure-temperature-time (P-T-t) paths of mafic magmas using a combination of short-timescale cooling and decompression chronometers. Recent work has shown that the thermal histories of crystals in the last few seconds to hours of eruption can be constrained using concentration gradients of MgO inside olivine-hosted melt inclusions, produced in response to syneruptive cooling and crystallization of olivine on the inclusion walls. We have applied this technique to the study of melt inclusions erupted by arc and ocean island volcanoes, including the 1974 subplinian eruption of Fuego volcano; the 1977 fire-fountain eruption of Seguam volcano; and three eruptions of Kilauea volcano (episode 1 of the 1959 Kilauea Iki fire-fountain eruption, the 1500 CE vigorous fire-fountain eruption, and the 1650 CE subplinian eruption). Of the eruptions studied so far, melt inclusions from the 1959 Kilauea Iki eruption record the highest syneruptive cooling rates (3–11°C/s) and the shortest cooling durations (4–19 s), while inclusions from the 1974 Fuego eruption record the slowest cooling rates (0.1–1.7°C/s) and longest cooling durations (21–368 s). The high cooling rates inferred for the Kilauea Iki and Seguam fire fountain eruptions are consistent with air quenching over tens of seconds during and after fragmentation and eruption. Melt inclusions sampled from the interiors of small (∼6 cm diameter) volcanic bombs at Fuego are found to have cooled more slowly on average than inclusions sampled from ash (with particle diameters &lt; 2 mm) during the same eruption, as expected based on conductive cooling models. We find evidence for a systematic relationship between cooling rates and decompression rates of magmas, in which rapidly ascending gas-bearing magmas experience slower cooling during ascent and eruption than slowly ascending magmas. Our magma P-T-t constraints for the Kilauea Iki eruption are in broad agreement with isentropic models that show that the dominant driver of cooling in the conduit is adiabatic expansion of a vapor phase; however, at Fuego and Seguam, our results suggest a significant role for latent heat production and/or open-system degassing (both of which violate assumptions required for isentropic ascent). We thereby caution against the application of isentropic conduit models to magmas containing relatively high initial water concentrations (e.g., arc magmas containing ∼4 wt% water). We note that several processes that have been inferred to occur in volcanic conduits such as magma stalling, magma mingling, open- and closed-system degassing, vapor fluxing, and vapor accumulation (in foam layers or as slugs of gas) are associated with different implied vapor volume fractions during syneruptive ascent. Given the sensitivity of magma P-T-t paths to vapor volume fraction, the syneruptive thermometer presented here may be a means of identifying these processes during the seconds to hours preceding the eruption of mafic magmas.</p>}}
